Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being

This goal aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. The 

project in the project implemented in Keelakarai village aligns strongly with Sustainable 

Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, as it focuses on improving 

healthcare access, sanitation, nutrition, and overall well-being. The initiative introduces 

basic health facilities, such as mobile health clinics and telemedicine services, to ensure 

remote communities have access to quality healthcare. These interventions help reduce 

maternal and child mortality rates by providing essential prenatal and postnatal care. 

Additionally, health education programs focus on preventive measures, such as hygiene 

practices and nutrition, reducing the incidence of preventable diseases. The project 

directly contributes to enhancing the quality of life, addressing both immediate health 

needs and long-term well-being for the population of Keelakarai.
